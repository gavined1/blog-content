# The Future of AI: Trends to Watch in 2025

Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize industries across the globe. From healthcare to finance, AI is reshaping how we interact with technology.

## 1. Generative AI Becomes Mainstream

Generative AI, including models that create text, images, and music, is rapidly expanding. Expect more tools that allow businesses and individuals to produce content effortlessly.

```javascript
// Example: Using AI to generate text content
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a short blog intro about AI trends.' }]
});
console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

## 2. AI in Healthcare

AI is improving diagnostics, personalized medicine, and patient care. Advanced models can predict diseases, assist in surgeries, and optimize treatment plans.

## 3. Ethical AI and Regulation

As AI grows, ethical concerns are rising. Transparency, bias mitigation, and regulatory compliance are becoming central priorities for developers and organizations.

## 4. AI in Automation and Robotics

Robotics powered by AI will continue to transform manufacturing, logistics, and even household tasks, increasing efficiency while reducing human error.

## 5. AI-Powered Personal Assistants

Intelligent assistants will become more proactive, integrating deeply into our workflows, automating tasks, and providing personalized recommendations.

## Best Practices for AI Adoption

1. **Start Small** - Begin with pilot projects.
