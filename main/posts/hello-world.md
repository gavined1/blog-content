# Hello World 👋

Welcome to my **new Markdown-based blog** built with Next.js 16, GitHub, and Vercel!

This post is written in plain Markdown, fetched directly from my GitHub repository, and rendered automatically on the site.

## 🚀 Features
- Written in Markdown
- Stored in a public GitHub repo
- Auto-fetched and cached using Next.js revalidation
- Styled with Tailwind’s `prose` class

## 💡 What’s Next
Soon I’ll be adding:
- Comments
- Automatic revalidation via GitHub Actions
- More posts like this one!

Thanks for reading 🙌  
Stay tuned for more!
